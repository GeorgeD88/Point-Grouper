# Point-Grouper
Point Grouper is a simple python project that can take a list of points on a graph, average them into one point, and then graph everything (regular points in black, averaged point in red). Point Grouper doesn't have a GUI or input method so it's more of a programming tool to be used with other projects.

## Example
Here's an example run of the program

Points: `[(-1, 3), (2, -4), (1, 0), (3, -2), (-1, 0)]`
